***A full-stack Issue Tracker application built using the MERN stack following the learning-first approach.*** 

**This project focuses on understanding how React, Node, Express, and MongoDB work together, without relying on heavy scaffolding tools.**


# Tech Stack

-Frontend: React (no CRA), React Router

-Backend: Node.js, Express

-Database: MongoDB

-Tooling: Webpack, Babel, npm scripts


# Features

-Create, view, edit, and delete issues

-Filter issues by status and effort

-RESTful API with Express

-MongoDB persistence

-Single Page Application (SPA) with React

-Controlled forms and client-side routing


# Development Approach

**The app is built incrementally, just like a real product:**

-Start with basic React UI

-Add reusable components

-Build REST APIs with Express

-Connect MongoDB

-Add routing, filtering, validation

-Prepare for production

-No code generators, everything is added step by step.

***Why No create-react-app?***

-This project intentionally avoids CRA to:

-Understand Webpack & Babel setup

-Learn how React integrates with Node/Express

-Avoid black-box abstractions

-Gain real production-level understanding

-CRA is great for speed, this approach is for mastery.
